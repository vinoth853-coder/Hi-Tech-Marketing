of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

          <p className="text-white">Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;
He has come to His people and set them free.
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,
born of the house of His servant David.
Through His holy prophets he promised of old
that he would save us from our enemies,
from the hands of all who hate us.
He promised to show mercy to our fathers
and to remember His holy covenant.
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,
free to worship him without fear,
holy and righteous in His sight all the days of our life.
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;
for You will go before the Lord to prepare His way,
to give His people knowledge of salvation
by the forgiveness of their sins.
In the tender compassion of our God
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,
and to guide our feet into the way of peace. (Luke 1:68-79)</p>

          <p className="text-white">My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;
for he has looked with favor on His lowly servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed:
the Almighty has done great things for me,
and holy is His Name.
He has mercy on those who fear Him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of His arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty.
He has come to the help of His servant Israel
for He has remembered His promise of mercy,
the promise He made to our fathers,
to Abraham and His children for ever. (Luke 1:46-55)
O eternal God and Ruler of all creation, You have allowed me to reach this hour. Forgive the sins
I have committed this day by word, deed or thought. Purify me, O Lord, from every spiritual and
physical stain. Grant that I may rise from this sleep to glorify You by my deeds throughout my
entire lifetime, and that I be victorious over every spiritual and physical enemy. Deliver me, O
Lord, from all vain thoughts and from evil desires, for yours is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and forever. Amen.</p>

Protect us, Lord, as we stay awake;
watch over us as we sleep,

and asleep, rest in His peace (alleluia).
Lord, now let Your servant go in peace;
according to Your word:
for my eyes have seen Your salvation
which You have prepared in the presence of all
peoples: a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to Your people Israel. (Luke 2:29–32)
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now
